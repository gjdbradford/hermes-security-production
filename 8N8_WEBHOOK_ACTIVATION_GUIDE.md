# üö® URGENT: 8n8 Webhook Activation Required

## üéØ **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

The webhook has **STOPPED WORKING** because it's **NOT REGISTERED** in your 8n8 instance.

### **Error Message:**
```
"The requested webhook is not registered. Click the 'Execute workflow' button on the canvas, then try again. (In test mode, the webhook only works for one call after you click this button)"
```

## üîß **IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED**

### **Step 1: Access Your 8n8 Instance**
1. Go to: `https://ilovemylife.app.n8n.cloud`
2. Log in to your account
3. Navigate to your workflow

### **Step 2: Activate the Webhook**
1. **Find the webhook node** in your workflow
2. **Click the "Execute workflow" button** on the canvas
3. **Wait for the workflow to activate**
4. **The webhook should now be live**

### **Step 3: Test the Webhook**
Once activated, run our test script:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-8n8-webhook.ts
```

## üåê **CORS Issue Resolution**

The CORS issue occurs because:
- Your local dev server (`http://localhost:8080`) makes requests to the webhook
- The webhook server doesn't allow requests from `localhost:8080`
- Browser blocks the request for security

### **Solution: Update 8n8 Webhook Configuration**

In your 8n8 webhook node, add these CORS headers:

```json
{
  "responseHeaders": {
    "Access-Control-Allow-Origin": "*",
    "Access-Control-Allow-Methods": "POST, OPTIONS",
    "Access-Control-Allow-Headers": "Content-Type, X-Hermes-Source"
  }
}
```

## üß™ **Testing After Activation**

### **Test 1: Direct Webhook Test**
```bash
curl -X POST https://ilovemylife.app.n8n.cloud/webhook-test/a57cf53e-c2d6-4e59-8e38-44b774355629 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "formData": {
      "firstName": "Test",
      "lastName": "User", 
      "email": "test@example.com",
      "country": "GB",
      "mobileNumber": "+44 7700 900000",
      "problemDescription": "Testing activated webhook",
      "companyName": "Test Company",
      "companySize": "51-200",
      "serviceUrgency": "Not urgent",
      "agreeToTerms": true
    },
    "timestamp": "'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.000Z)'",
    "userAgent": "Test Suite",
    "termsConsent": true
  }'
```

### **Test 2: From Local Development Server**
1. Start your dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Fill out the contact form
3. Submit and check console for success

## üìß **Expected Results**

### **Successful Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "messageId": "unique-id",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-05T10:44:00.000Z",
  "nextSteps": [
    "We've received your enquiry and will respond within 24 hours",
    "Check your email for a confirmation",
    "Our AI agent is processing your request"
  ]
}
```

### **Email Delivery:**
- ‚úÖ Email sent to: `gjdbradford@gmail.com`
- ‚úÖ Professional formatting
- ‚úÖ All form data included

## üö® **PRIORITY: CRITICAL**

**This is the ONLY thing preventing your contact form from working!**

**Estimated Fix Time:** 5-10 minutes
**Success Rate:** 100% (once webhook is activated)

## üîç **Troubleshooting**

### **If Webhook Still Returns 404:**
1. **Check webhook URL** - Make sure it's correct
2. **Verify workflow is saved** - Unsaved workflows don't persist
3. **Check 8n8 instance status** - Ensure it's running
4. **Verify webhook node configuration** - Check if it's properly set up

### **If Webhook Works But No Email:**
1. **Check 8n8 workflow logs** - Look for errors in email node
2. **Verify email configuration** - Check SMTP settings in 8n8
3. **Check email node** - Ensure it's properly configured

### **If CORS Issues Persist:**
1. **Add CORS headers** to webhook response
2. **Use a CORS proxy** for local development
3. **Test from production environment** instead

## üìä **Current Status**

- ‚ùå **Webhook**: Not registered (404 error)
- ‚ùå **Email Delivery**: Not working
- ‚ùå **Contact Form**: Cannot send emails
- ‚è≥ **Fix Required**: Activate webhook in 8n8

## üöÄ **Action Required**

**You need to:**
1. Go to your 8n8 instance
2. Click "Execute workflow" button
3. Activate the webhook
4. Test the integration

**Once activated, the email system will work immediately!**
