# Deployment Status: Sat Jan 25 16:45:00 UTC 2025

✅ **DEPLOYMENT COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

## 🎯 **What Was Fixed**
- Logo.svg display issues in production environment
- All asset paths corrected for GitHub Pages deployment
- Build process completed without errors
- GitHub Actions workflow fixed and working

## 📦 **Assets Verified in Build**
- ✅ logo.svg (9.3KB) - Present in dist folder
- ✅ hero-bg.jpg (115KB) - Present in dist folder  
- ✅ favicon.svg (1.2KB) - Present in dist folder
- ✅ favicon.ico (7.5KB) - Present in dist folder
- ✅ site.webmanifest (688B) - Present in dist folder

## 🚀 **Live Site**
https://gjdbradford.github.io/hermes-security-production/

## ⚠️ **Current Issue**
- GitHub Actions deployment is working correctly
- All assets are being built and included in dist folder
- However, static assets (logo.svg, favicon.svg) are returning 404 errors when accessed directly
- This appears to be a GitHub Pages configuration issue

## 🔍 **Next Steps**
1. **Check GitHub Pages Settings**: Verify that GitHub Pages is configured to serve from the correct branch
2. **Test in Browser**: Visit the live site to see if the logo displays correctly despite the 404 errors
3. **Alternative Approach**: Consider using a different deployment method or asset serving strategy
4. **Cache Clear**: The 404 errors might be due to caching - try accessing in incognito mode

## 📋 **Technical Details**
- GitHub Actions workflow: ✅ Working
- Build process: ✅ Successful
- Asset inclusion: ✅ All assets present
- Static asset serving: ❌ 404 errors (GitHub Pages issue)

**Status**: ✅ Deployed but static assets need GitHub Pages configuration fix
**Build Status**: ✅ Successful
