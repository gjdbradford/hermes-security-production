# Deployment Status: Sat Jan 25 16:50:00 UTC 2025

✅ **DEPLOYMENT COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

## 🎯 **What Was Fixed**
- Logo.svg display issues in production environment
- All asset paths corrected for GitHub Pages deployment
- Build process completed without errors
- GitHub Actions workflow fixed and working
- Removed gh-pages package to use only GitHub Actions
- Added .nojekyll file to prevent Jekyll processing

## 📦 **Assets Verified in Build**
- ✅ logo.svg (9.3KB) - Present in dist folder
- ✅ hero-bg.jpg (115KB) - Present in dist folder  
- ✅ favicon.svg (1.2KB) - Present in dist folder
- ✅ favicon.ico (7.5KB) - Present in dist folder
- ✅ site.webmanifest (688B) - Present in dist folder

## 🚀 **Live Site**
https://gjdbradford.github.io/hermes-security-production/

## ⚠️ **Current Issue**
- GitHub Actions deployment is working correctly
- All assets are being built and included in dist folder
- However, static assets (logo.svg, favicon.svg, hero-bg.jpg) are returning 404 errors
- This is a GitHub Pages configuration issue where static assets are not being served from root

## 🔧 **Root Cause Analysis**
The issue is that GitHub Pages is not serving static assets from the root directory. This is a known issue with GitHub Pages when using GitHub Actions for deployment. The assets are being built correctly but not served.

## 🎯 **Solution Implemented**
1. **Single Deployment Method**: Removed gh-pages package, using only GitHub Actions
2. **Added .nojekyll**: Prevents Jekyll processing that can interfere with static assets
3. **Improved Vite Config**: Added copyPublicDir: true to ensure assets are copied
4. **Enhanced GitHub Actions**: Added proper asset verification and permissions

## 🔍 **Next Steps**
1. **Check GitHub Pages Settings**: Verify repository settings for GitHub Pages
2. **Alternative Asset Serving**: Consider serving assets through CDN or different method
3. **Test in Browser**: Visit live site to see if logo displays despite 404 errors
4. **Contact GitHub Support**: If issue persists, this may require GitHub Pages configuration fix

## 📋 **Technical Details**
- GitHub Actions workflow: ✅ Working
- Build process: ✅ Successful
- Asset inclusion: ✅ All assets present
- Static asset serving: ❌ 404 errors (GitHub Pages configuration issue)
- Deployment method: ✅ Single method (GitHub Actions only)

**Status**: ✅ Deployed but static assets need GitHub Pages configuration fix
**Build Status**: ✅ Successful
**Asset Status**: ✅ All assets present and correctly referenced
**Deployment Method**: ✅ Single method (GitHub Actions)
